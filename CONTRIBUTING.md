## Contributions are welcome!

But before that! Please read the guidelines/requirements below:

- The added blueprint needs to be unique enough so that it can't be replicated by another blueprint already present (to some extent)

- A blueprint can be replaced by another if they are similar enough but the newer blueprint has a significant improvment (response time, cleaner code, etc.)

- If a completely new blueprint is added, that being a completly new device, please make sure it works since I have no way of testing code for a device that I do not own myself.
